GROSS DESCRIPTION

 
   The patient demographics and specimen identification on the requisition correspond to
   that on the specimen container.  The specimen is received in two containers, all of
   which are received in formalin.
 
   A.The specimen is received in formalin in a container labelled "Right Breast Core
   Biopsy A.". Within the container, one cassette, labelled with the patient's last
   name, first initial on one side, birthdate on the other. The cassette is labelled as
   to contain 4 cores. Submitted in toto in the original cassette labelled A. 
 
   B.The specimen is received in formalin in a container labelled "Right Breast Core
   Biopsy B.". Within the container, 2 cassettes, labelled with the patient's last name,
   first initial on one side, birthdate on the other. The cassettes are labelled as to
   contain 4 cores in cassette #one, 2 cores in cassette #2. Submitted in toto in their
   original cassettes labelled B1-2.

DIAGNOSIS

   A. Breast (RIGHT, MID 9 o'clock), needle core biopsy: 
   -INVASIVE AND IN SITU DUCTAL CARCINOMA-SEE COMMENT 
   -Microcalcifications present, associated with DCIS
 
   Comment: In this limited needle core biopsy sampling, the invasive ductal carcinoma
   appears of no special type, and has an estimated overall Modified Bloom and
   Richardson Histologic Tumor Grade of III (nuclear score 2/3, mitotic score 2/3,
   tubular score 3/3). Ductal carcinoma in situ with nuclear grade 2/3, associated
   comedonecrosis, is also present and associated with the invasive ductal carcinoma.
   Definitive tumor subtyping/grading is deferred to the excisional biopsy specimen.
 
   Hormone receptors (ER and PR) and HER2 will be reported as an addendum.
 
   B. Axilla (RIGHT, MID), needle core biopsy: 
   -POSITIVE FOR DUCTAL CARCINOMA 
   -No definite lymphoid tissue identified 
 
   Hormone receptors (ER and PR) and HER2 will be reported as an addendum.
 
   ********************PATHOLOGIC/RADIOLOGIC CORRELATION******************** 
   The case has been reviewed by the Pathology/Radiology Panel. As per the Radiologists
   present (Drs. Three and Four), the presented pathological findings CORRELATE
   with the radiographic findings. 
 
   As such, the Radiologists recommend surgical consult and MRI.
 
   For further information, please refer to the patient's clinical chart and radiology
   notes.
