 DISCHARGE SUMMARY
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Dear Drs. Provider Three, Provider Four and Provider Ten:
 
 As you are aware, Patient Two was diagnosed with breast cancer in April 2014.  She was
 admitted to hospital on July 1, 2014 with abdominal pain and acute kidney injury and
 hypercalcemia.  She was managed by the Medical Oncology Unit and was preparing for
 discharge home when she experienced sudden acute hypoxic episode as well as severe
 hypotension.
 
 She was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit and as per the wishes of her husband,
 intubated and treated with fluids and vasopressors.  Over the subsequent 36 hours.  Patient
 Two's status varied. At 1111, Patient Two began to stabalize and recover.
 
 She is being referred back to the Medical Oncology Unit to revisit medications and 
 explore options for pallative care.

 If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.
 
 Sincerely,
