 2.  Respirology.  
   
 SUMMARY OF COURSE IN HOSPITAL:  
 The patient is a very pleasant 43-year-old female who was admitted through the ER for a  
 chief complaint of fever and a subsequent workup.  The patient had a complaint of a  
 2-week history of cough, dyspnea as well as a sick contacts at home who are her children,  
 and a recorded febrile temperature at home of 38 degrees.  

 In the ER, initial workup with a chest x-ray and cultures showed a presumptive diagnosis 
 of a right middle lobe infiltrate suspicious for a community-acquired pneumonia.  The 
 patient was subsequently admitted to the Hospitalist Service for further management.  
 Throughout the hospital course, the patient remained hemodynamically stable, at the most 
 requiring only half a liter to 1 liter of oxygen which was eventually weaned off after 
 subsequent treatment. In suspicion for ongoing pneumonia involving the bilateral lower lobes, 
 cultures were obtained which remained negative throughout the hospital course.  The patient 
 was started on broad spectrum antibiotics, with further imaging done with a CT scan of  
 the chest.  

 CT scan of the chest was impressive for an interval development of extensive  
 ground-glass abnormality in both lungs, along with regions of consolidation in the lower  
 lobes, but given the elevated white count, an infectious etiology was possible; however,  
 consideration for drug-induced diffuse alveolar damage and pneumonitis from recent chemo  
 was a possibility.  Respirology was consulted for an opinion to see if a bronchoscopy  
 would be beneficial, but they deemed that no bronchoscopy would be done at this time.  
 They recommended continuation of antibiotics and close monitoring, and also recommended 
 possibility of starting systemic steroids as it may provide some benefit for pneumonitis.  

 Medical Oncology also evaluated. The patient's primary oncologist, Dr. Provider Three, 
 agreed with ongoing treatment with antibiotics.  

 On day of discharge, cultures remained negative. The patient remained hemodynamically stable.  
 She was on room air. Plan of care was explained to her.  The patient was in agreement to 
 discharge with the followup plan with the Medical Oncology Service.
