                            ONCOLOGY CONSULT NOTE  
  
  
Dear Dr. Provider One,  
  
Thank you for referring Patient One, a 43-year-old woman to be seen today in the  
Medical Oncology Clinic regarding neoadjuvant treatment options for her right-sided  
locally advanced invasive ductal carcinoma, biopsy proven to involve lymph nodes.  Full  
staging investigations pending.  She is part of the PET ABC study.  Biopsy shows receptor  
status ER 86% positive, PR 12% positive and HER2 negative by IHC.  She presents with a 6.5  
cm palpable mass as well as 3 cm palpable lymph node.  A full consultation will be  
dictated by the resident working with me in clinic; however, I will summarize pertinent  
details.  
  
She detected some skin thickening in summer 2018, which prompted medical investigations 
including mammogram, ultrasound and biopsy ultimately carried out in September confirming 
invasive breast cancer.  Imaging suggested calcifications over a span of 11.2 cm and she 
presented with a large palpable lump.  

A PET scan has been carried out which does not confirm metastatic disease, but raises a 
number of nonspecific abnormalities including mediastinal lymph nodes and periaortic 
lymph node, nonspecific uptake in the liver and nonspecific uptake in the bones, 
particularly at T10.  These areas will all require further imaging for followup.  
Also, she has an MRI of the breasts coming up.  
  
She is otherwise healthy, really with no significant comorbidities.
  
IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  
We have discussed the uncertainty around staging.  In the event that metastatic disease  
is ruled out I would strongly support the role for neoadjuvant chemotherapy to be  
followed by subsequent surgery, radiation and endocrine therapy.  If, however, she has  
metastatic disease which is ER positive, we may take an entirely different treatment  
approach such as endocrine therapy with a CDK4 inhibitor.  I think that accurate staging  
here is critical for a care plan.  

I will ask for an urgent MRI of the liver as well as CT chest, abdomen and pelvis.  
I will meet with her to review the results.  For the time being, she feels  
she has sufficient supports but she will call me if things change.
