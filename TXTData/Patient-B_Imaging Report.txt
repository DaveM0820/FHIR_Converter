Procedures: 3007-0103 MRI/MR SPI 3SEG COMPL SERIES W/GAD
 
MRI OF THE WHOLE SPINE
 Routine sequences
 
 INDICATION: 51-year-old with metastatic breast cancer.
 
 FINDINGS: No previous available
 
 The spinal alignment is normal. There is 50% compression fracture involving T2
 associated with posterior convex margin and mild retropulsion effacing the
 anterior CSF with no current evidence of cord compression. There is a small
 element of extra osseous soft tissue component at the anterior aspect of the
 vertebral body. There is obliteration of bilateral neural foramen at T2-T3 level
 probably related to bony expansion. I cannot confidently exclude extra dural
 soft tissue resulting in neural foraminal effacement. The spinal cord is normal
 in signal at this level with only a small trace of CSF seen at the posterior
 aspect of the spinal cord at this level..
 
 There is suspicious nodularity seen in the cauda equina best demonstrated on the
 sagittal view examination in particular at L3 level [series 4 image 9]. The
 finding cannot be confirmed on the axial examination.
 
 There is epidural lipomatosis at L5-S1 level with narrowing of the central
 canal.
 
 10% superior endplate depression at T6 level. There is 20% height loss at T11
 with mild superior and inferior endplate depression at T13. 20% height loss also
 seen at L5 level. There is also mild superior endplate depression at L4 level
 centrally. No retropulsion seen at any of these level.
 
 There is degenerative disc/endplate change from C3-C7 level resulting in mild to
 moderate central canal narrowing.
 
 Note is made of extensive subcutaneous soft tissue masses/ deposits along the
 chest wall and in the right upper arm largest in the posterior neck at C3-C4
 level measuring 3.4 x 2.1 cm. 
 
 From this limited examination, there is a suspicion of a left hilar mass
 resulting in partial collapse of the left upper lobe.
 
 OPINION:
 Diffuse osseous metastasis throughout the visualized skeleton. There is 40%
 compression fracture at T2 level with retropulsion resulting in severe central
 canal stenosis with no current evidence of cord compression. The patient however
 is at risk of impending cord compression. There is suspicious paravertebral soft
 tissue at the anterior aspect of T2. Obliteration of the neural foramen at T2-T3
 level which may be related to a combination of bony expansion and extra dural
 soft tissue.
 
 Questionable nodules involving the cauda equina concerning of leptomeningeal
 disease involvement/drop metastasis. Unfortunately due to renal impairment [GFR
 less than 30], we cannot administer intravenous gadolinium to confirm/excluded
 this finding.
 
 The findings have been discussed with Dr. Provider Six
