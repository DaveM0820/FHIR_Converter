 PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  
 Locally advanced right breast cancer post neoadjuvant chemotherapy.  
   
 NAME OF PROCEDURE:  
 Left modified radical mastectomy including left axillary lymph node dissection.  
   
 DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  
 The surgical safety checklist was completed.  Prophylactic antibiotics and Heparin were  
 given.  The surgical pause was again completed.  The righ breast, chest wall, proximal  
 arm and axilla were prepped and draped in the usual sterile technique.  The skin ellipse  
 was measured out to include the previous biopsy, nipple areolar complex and any redundant  
 skin.  There were 2 skin lesions medially that I excised which may have been impacted by  
 the dressing postoperatively given their proximity to the mastectomy incision.  They were  
 sent in formalin.  

 A 15 blade scalpel was used to make the incision.  Skin hooks were placed.  Dissection 
 was carried superiorly to the inferior aspect of the clavicle, medially to the sternum, 
 inferiorly in inframammary fold and laterally to latissimus.   
 
 The entire breast was taken off the chest wall, including pectoralis fascia.  Laterally  
 the pectoralis major and minor were elevated.  There were no interpectoral nodes. The medial  
 pectoral bundle was preserved, along with the long thoracic nerve, thoracodorsal artery and 
 vein. 

 There was a bit of fibrofatty tissue along the subscapularis that was sent separately 
 as deep tissue and again a complete level 1 and 2 axillary lymph node dissection with the 
 specimen kept in continuity down to the confluence of the latissimus and serratus.  

 A specimen was labeled short stitch superior long lateral which was left breast and axillary 
 lymph nodes and deep tissue sent separately.  The skin lesions were also sent separately.  
 The wound was checked for hemostasis.  Estimated blood loss was minimal.  Surgicel was placed 
 after tranexamic acid solution.  Topical was irrigated into the cavity.  

 Two Jackson-Pratt drains were placed, 1 into the axillary space and 1 across the chest wall 
 with subdermal 3-0 Vicryl, 4-0 Monocryl.  The drain sutures were 2-0 nylon to secure the 
 drains laterally and then Dermabond 4-0 Monocryl for final skin closure, Steri-Strips and 
 pressure dressing with abdominal binder.  

 No complications.  Sponge, instrument and needle counts were correct at the completion of the procedure.
