 BAC MAMMOGRAM BILATERAL 2V EA, BAC U/S BREAST LEFT      
   
 BREAST ASSESSMENT      
   
 CLINICAL INDICATION: 43-year-old female. History as per the technologist's notes  
 indicates left breast lump for a couple of weeks.  
   
 FINDINGS:  
   
 Bilateral mammogram:  
   
 Left breast: There are segmental pleomorphic calcifications at the 9:00
 position. These span over a length of up to 12 cm on the CC projection. There  
 appears to be 3 separate clusters of pleomorphic calcifications, the largest  
 approximately 5.3 cm from nipple where there is an associated high density,  
 spiculated mass with indistinct borders.   
   
 There is another area of suspicious pleomorphic calcifications at the 6:00  
 position concerning for multicentric disease. This region measures up to 1 cm on  
 the CC projection.  
   
 Skin thickening noted. There are also enlarged left axillary lymph nodes which  
 contain calcifications.  
   
 Left breast: No suspicious masses, calcifications or architectural distortion.  
   
 Ultrasound:  
   
 In the region of palpable concern, 9:00, is an irregular hypoechoic mass which  
 contains calcifications and internal vascularity measuring 2.2 x 2.4 x 1.9 cm.  
 2.7 cm separate from this, in the retroareolar region at 9:00, is another  
 hypoechoic mass containing calcifications measuring 1.6 x 1.4 x 0.9 cm.  
 Together, these 2 abnormal masses span a length of 6.8 cm.  
   
 There is abnormal left axillary lymph node measuring 4.4 x 1.9 x 2.5 cm with a  
 thickened cortex, measuring 1.1 cm, which contains calcifications. A second  
 abnormal appearing lymph node measuring 1.0 x 0.8 x 0.7 cm is also seen. A few  
 other smaller abnormal appearing lymph nodes are also identified in the axilla.  
   
 INTERPRETATION:  
   
 The patient's palpable concern correlates to an irregular, spiculated, 2.9 cm  
 mass at the 9:00 position in the left breast. A separate abnormal 1.3 cm area at 
 9:00, in the retroareolar region is also identified. This is associated with  
 extensive segmental pleomorphic microcalcifications measuring up to 11 cm in  
 keeping with locally advanced disease.  
   
 A separate focus of suspicious calcifications at the 6:00 position which is  
 concerning for multicentric disease. Pathologic-appearing left axillary lymph  
 nodes are identified. Abnormal skin thickening is present.  
   
 The patient has been booked for ultrasound-guided biopsy on Monday. At that time, 
 focused sonography in the 6:00 region will be performed in the area of 
 microcalcifications to see if an associated sonographic lesion is present in this area.  
   
 Consideration for MRI to assess for disease extent is advised.  
   
 BI-RADS: 5. Highly suggestive of malignancy. Biopsy has been arranged.
