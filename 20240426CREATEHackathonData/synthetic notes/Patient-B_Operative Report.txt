 PROCEDURE:
 Bronchoscopy.
 
 INDICATION:
 For bronchial toilet, BAL and immunocompromised host.
 
 In preparation for the procedure, Patient Two's propofol and Fentanyl were increased
 slightly.  Xylocaine 2% was instilled into the endotracheal tube.  Throughout the
 procedure, she maintained a blood pressure of greater than 100 and a sat of 100%.
 
 PROCEDURE:
 The endotracheal tube was in good position.  There was quite a bit of yellow secretions
 in the trachea which was aspirated and sent for culture.  The left main, left upper lobe,
 left lower lobe and lingula were normal.  There were minimal secretions.  The left main
 and left upper lobe were normal.  The right middle lobe and right lower lobe were
 slightly edematous.  There was organized fibrin clot in the right lower lobe.  I was able
 to remove some of it, but a remnant in a small airway in the right lower lobe did
 persist.  There was minimal amount of scope trauma.  There was some yellow-white
 secretions in the left lower lobe in which we did a BAL with 70 mL in and 20 mL out.
 
 The scope was withdrawn and the patient tolerated the procedure well.
